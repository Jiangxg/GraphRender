# GraphRender
We develop a renderer for [PMPI] (https://github.com/Jiangxg/PMPI)

The project is implemented in C++ and CUDA, without OpenGL.

## Installation
We provide a compile.sh file to compile this project.
```shell
cd workdir/GraphRender
chmod 777 compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

## Model for Rendering
For now, GraphRender only supports our proposed PMPI model.

And we are working on adding point cloud into the list.
